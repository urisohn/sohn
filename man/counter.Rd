\usage{
counter(simk)
}
\arguments{
\item{simk}{The current iteration number}
}
\value{
Prints progress updates (invisibly returns NULL)
}
\description{
Function that adaptively finds the frequency with which to report simulation
progress so that it reports approximately within 5 seconds.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Monitors execution time at checkpoints (iterations 2, 5, 10, 50)
  \item Automatically determines an optimal reporting interval based on a
    target time (5 seconds by default)
  \item Prints progress updates at the chosen interval
  \item Adapts to fast or slow iterations
}

The reporter works in two phases:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Discovery phase}: Checks execution time at checkpoints. If
    any checkpoint takes longer than the target time, it sets the reporting
    interval to that checkpoint value.
  \item \strong{Reporting phase}: Once an interval is chosen, it reports
    progress every N iterations, where N is the chosen interval.
}

If all checkpoints complete quickly (before reaching iteration 50), the
function estimates an appropriate interval based on the average time per
iteration.

State (simk and time) is tracked within the function's environment.

\examples{
# Use it in a simulation loop
for (i in 1:100) {
  # Your simulation code here
  Sys.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate work
  counter(i)  # Report progress
}

# The reporter will automatically determine when to print updates
# based on how long each iteration takes

}
